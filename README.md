You are starting a colony on Mars. You gain resources over time, and buy items to alter that resource gain.

## Resources
Resources are used to buy things, keep things running, and unlock items.
- Credits
- Energy
- Population
- Research

## Purchasable Items
You can buy things with credits. Items unlock as you gain research points.
### Current Items
- Solar Panel: Adds to energy rate
- Battery: Adds to energy cap
- Potato Farm: Adds to population cap, subtracts from energy rate

## Game Mechanics
### Energy
For half a sol energy rate rises, for the other half it decreases. Buying things alters the rate at which it rises or falls.
