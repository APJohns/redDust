# redDust
You are starting a colony on Mars. You gain resources over time, and buy items to alter that resource gain.

## Resources
Resources are used to buy things, keep things running, and unlock items.
- Credits
- Energy
- Population
- Research

## Purchasable Items
You can buy things with credits. Items unlock as you gain research points.
### Items
- Solar Panel: Adds to energy rate during the day
- Battery: Adds to energy cap
- Potato Farm: Adds to population cap, subtracts from energy rate
- Labs: Increases research rate, subtracts from energy rate
- Landing Pad: Increases population rate, subtracts from energy rate

### Upgrades
- Battery Efficiency: Deecreses the energy fall off rate at night by a defined percent

## Game Mechanics
### Energy
For half a sol energy rate rises, for the other half it decreases. Buying things alters the rate at which it rises or falls.

### Save
The game saves data locally at the end of every sol.
